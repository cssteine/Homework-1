<h2 class="subtitle"> About Connor </h2>
<p> I grew up in La Motte, a small (population: 220), farm town in eastern Iowa .
I am a 22 year old student at the University of Iowa. I am currently
a fifth-year senior double majoring in MIS and accounting and I 
plan on graduating May 2013. In Spring 2011 I interned with McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP and I received a full-time offer
as an audit associate. I plan to sit for CPA next summer and will be
starting with McGladrey in October of 2013. Prior to McGladrey I 
drove Cambus for about one year and I must say that it is a lot easier than it looks.

</p>
<p>
My initial intention when starting my accounting degree was to receive 
my Masters in Accountancy. However, in the fall semester of 2011 
I realized and decided that switching to a double major in MIS would
allow me to broaden my horizons a little more and allow me to graduate
earlier than I anticipated. I have one semester under my belt as an MIS major and
I am happy to say that I do not regret my decision.
</p>
<p>
I recently got engaged over the summer to my current fiance&eacute;, 
Emily Gerhke. She currently is a personal trainer at CRWC. She is
certified in multiple forms of yoga and she has her Russian Kettlebell Certification.
We recently went to Denver, Colorado for vacation which is where I proposed. 
We also did a lot of boating over the summer
on my father's boat, which is one my favorite things to do. 
We spend most of our boating time on the Mississippi River.
I also enjoy hanging out with friends and playing sports. My absolute 
favorite sport to play is golf. I was able to play a few rounds while
in Denver and I could not have imagined more beautiful golf courses.
